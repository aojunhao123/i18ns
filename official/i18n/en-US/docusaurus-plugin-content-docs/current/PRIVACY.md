# PRIVACY

Updated on: February 25, 2025

## Data Collection and Usage

- We will collect information regarding your use of this application, such as usage frequency and the features you use. This data will be aggregated and will not identify any specific individual.
- When you translate web pages, your translation content is only sent to the translation engine of your choice for processing. We only collect usage statistics (such as translation frequency, feature usage, and other anonymous information) to provide you with a more convenient, high-quality translation experience and service improvements.
- When you use the file/image translation features provided by Immersive Translate, we will collect the content you input during the translation process (including images and files). This content needs to be analyzed and processed by our servers to extract translatable text. The extracted text is only sent to your chosen translation engine for processing, in order to provide you with convenient, high-quality translation results.
- When you use the BabelDOC translation feature provided by Immersive Translate, we collect and store your uploaded file content and error logs generated during the translation process, which are used to improve translation quality and optimize service experience.
- We will collect your device information (such as device ID, browser model, and version) to improve our services. The device ID will be used as an anonymous identifier and will not be associated with any of your personal identity information.
- If you log into the account system, we will need you to provide an email address, which will serve as your unique identifier, login name, and password recovery method.
- We may collect and use your IP address information to determine your country or region. This information is only used to provide localized service content and product optimization.
- We use Google Analytics to collect non-personally identifiable information, and the usage behavior data we collect will be processed anonymously.

## Data Sharing Situation

- We will not share your personal data with third-party vendors or partners, except as required by law.
- When you use our PDF document translation service provided to members, the PDF files you upload will be securely transmitted to our third-party service provider, Mathpix, for processing. This processing involves extracting the document content and generating machine-readable text necessary for translation. Throughout this process, we strictly adhere to the principle of data minimization, transmitting only the necessary files, and require Mathpix to employ industry-standard security measures to protect your documents. Once Mathpix completes the processing, the extracted content will be returned to us for generating your translation results. We will not use your original PDF or the extracted text for any other purposes, nor will we sell or share them with any third parties.
- Our app uses third-party translation services, which may collect some data to improve the quality of their services.

## Deletion of your data

Sometimes, your request will only be satisfied by closing your account.

## Explanation of Permissions for Safari Extensions

When you enable the Immersive Translation extension in the Safari browser, you will see a permission prompt stating: "This extension can read, modify sensitive information, including credit card details, etc." We understand this may cause concern, so we want to provide some background information and our commitment to your privacy:

**1. What does this prompt mean?**

This prompt is informing you that our translation extension needs permission to read and modify webpage content to provide translation services while you are browsing. This means the extension will see and process the text you are viewing and then translate it into the language you have specified.

Regarding **"sensitive information"**: Technically, the extension does have the capability to read all content on a webpage, including sensitive data you may enter. However, in reality, our translation extension focuses solely on converting text from one language to another and does not "pay attention to" or "collect" your personal information, such as credit card details.

**2. Why does only Safari show this prompt, while other browsers (such as Chrome, Edge) do not?**

This is mainly because different browsers have different privacy protection policies and prompting mechanisms. Safari prefers to inform users about all possible permission requests in advance, even if these permissions may only be used in a very limited way in practice. Chrome, on the other hand, might consider it unnecessary to prompt if the developers of an extension have already declared how they use these permissions.

Safari's approach is to ensure that users are fully aware of any extensions they install, even if such permissions may only be used in extreme cases or not at all.

**3. How do we use these permissions?**

The permission to access and modify webpage content allows our extension to translate the webpages you see from one language to another. Both in Safari and Chrome, we deeply understand the importance of privacy and commit to not requesting additional permissions unless absolutely necessary. We encourage all users, whether you are using Safari or Chrome, to read our privacy policy for a deeper understanding of how we collect, use, and protect your data. Our policy clearly outlines our commitment to and practices regarding user privacy.

If you have any questions or need consultation about our privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at support@immersivetranslate.com.
